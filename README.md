# Personal Student Result Center

This is a web application for managing and displaying student results. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to add and view their course details and grades.

## Getting Started
To get started with the application, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:

```shell
Copy code
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running the following command:

```shell
Copy code
npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application. The page will automatically reload if you make any changes to the source code.

## Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

### npm start
Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
The page will reload if you make any edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the running tests documentation for more information.

### npm run build
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include unique hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed! See the deployment documentation for more information.

### npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you are on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, if you need more customization options, eject gives you full control over the configuration.
